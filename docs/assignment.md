Summary
1. What This Is
This is a hands-on capability exercise to help you develop — and make visible — how you use AI tools effectively, responsibly, and practically across the data engineering lifecycle. Everyone in the competency takes part; it is a shared part of how we build AI capability, not something a few people are singled out for.
It is not a graded test. You will build a complete Databricks medallion data pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Dashboard) and show your thinking across sample data generation, ingestion, data quality validation, aggregations, and visualization. In return you get a feedback report and a clear sense of what to grow next.
What matters is not only whether the final pipeline works, but how you used AI for design, implementation, validation, testing, debugging, and reflection. Making your thinking visible is the point.
2. Who Takes Part
All data engineers in the competency, from individual contributor to Tech Lead level, working across cloud platforms and data stack tools (Databricks, PySpark, SQL, Python). Because everyone does it, there is a shared baseline and no one is measured against a different bar than their peers.
3. Time and Effort
The exercise is self-paced and meant to be completed within three weeks. You may work in any order; there is no required day-wise plan. Share your work by the agreed date.
Expected effort: The mandatory Core of the project is scoped for roughly 20-25 focused hours. The rest of the time goes into the lifecycle artifacts — requirement analysis, prompt history, data quality validation notes, testing and debugging notes, reflection — which are the main things the feedback looks at.
Do not expand the pipeline complexity at the expense of these artifacts.
4. What You Get Out of It
You receive a feedback report: your strengths, your growth areas, and concrete next steps for developing your AI-assisted data engineering workflow. The report also gives a sense of where you currently sit in the AI capability framework and what would move you forward — think of it as a snapshot and a direction, not a grade.
Feedback focuses on areas like:
Requirement analysis and problem understanding
Prompting and context-setting with AI tools
Tool workflow and integration
Data pipeline design (Bronze/Silver/Gold thinking)
Code quality and maintainability
Data quality validation depth
Testing and validation approach
Debugging methodology
Data contracts and schema thinking
Documentation and ownership
Responsible AI judgment

6. Part A: AI Workflow Foundation — Details
Objective
Show that you understand how AI should be used in practical data engineering — thoughtfully, not as a simple code-generation shortcut.
Expected Submission
Submit a document named tool-workflow.md covering:
Primary AI tool used (Cursor, Claude, etc.)
How you provide project context to the tool
How you use AI for requirement analysis
How you use AI for pipeline design (Bronze/Silver/Gold - Medallion Architecture)
How you use AI for code generation (Python/PySpark/SQL)
How you validate AI-generated code and logic
How you use AI for testing and validation
How you use AI for debugging (issues, root causes)
How you use AI for data quality checks
What information you avoid sharing unnecessarily with AI tools (e.g., real customer PII)
How you would reuse this workflow in a real production pipeline
Lessons learned: what worked, what didn't
7. Part B: Medallion Architecture Data Pipeline Project — Details
Objective
Demonstrate practical AI-assisted delivery through a realistic Medallion Architecture data engineering assignment. 
Business Context
Problem Statement:
An e-commerce company ingests daily sales data from multiple sources (customer database, order system, product catalog) into Databricks. They need to:
Bronze Layer: Ingest raw CSV files from S3/DBFS
Silver Layer: Apply data quality checks, clean and validate data
Gold Layer: Create business-ready aggregations for analytics
Dashboard: BI dashboards for business stakeholders
Common Technical Requirements
Whichever option you choose, every submission must include:
✅ Sample data generator script (creates realistic CSV files with intentional quality issues)
✅ Bronze layer ingestion code (Python/PySpark)
✅ Silver layer validation code (all 4 quality checks working)
✅ Gold layer aggregation code (all 4 aggregations)
✅ Dashboard queries (3+ SQL queries for visualizations)
✅ Database schema or setup script
✅ Seed/sample data (customers, orders, products CSVs)
✅ Input validation and error handling
✅ Data quality reporting
✅ At least one meaningful test tier (data quality tests, pipeline tests)
✅ README setup instructions
✅ Full prompt history (CRITICAL)
✅ All planning, design, testing, debugging, and reflection artifacts in the repository
The full set of lifecycle artifacts is required regardless of stretch tier. Only the application scope is small — the artifacts are the point.
Data Schema & Technical Setup
Source Files (S3/DBFS CSVs)
Table 1: customers.csv
customer_id (INT, Primary Key)
customer_name (STRING)
email (STRING)
country (STRING)
signup_date (DATE)
customer_segment (STRING: Premium/Standard/Basic)
lifetime_value (DECIMAL)
Sample rows: 10,000 customers | File size: ~500 KB
Table 2: orders.csv
order_id (INT, Primary Key)
customer_id (INT, Foreign Key → customers)
order_date (DATE)
product_id (INT, Foreign Key → products)
quantity (INT)
unit_price (DECIMAL)
total_amount (DECIMAL)
order_status (STRING: Pending/Completed/Cancelled)
payment_date (DATE, nullable)
Sample rows: 100,000 orders | File size: ~2-3 MB
Table 3: products.csv
product_id (INT, Primary Key)
product_name (STRING)
category (STRING)
price (DECIMAL)
cost (DECIMAL)
stock_quantity (INT)
reorder_level (INT)
Sample rows: 500 products | File size: ~50 KB
Data Quality Issues (Intentional)
Your sample data should include realistic quality issues for the Silver layer to catch:
customers.csv:
50 rows with NULL email (completeness)
10 rows with duplicate customer_id (uniqueness)
orders.csv:
100 rows with NULL customer_id (completeness)
200 rows with NULL product_id (completeness)
50 rows with customer_id not in customers table (referential integrity)
30 rows with product_id not in products table (referential integrity)
20 duplicate order_id rows (uniqueness)
Total issues: ~700 problematic rows out of ~100,000 (0.7% — realistic data quality)
Core Logic for Bronze to Gold layer
Five main components:
1. Sample Data Generation
Use Cursor to help design a Python/PySpark script
Generate all three CSVs with realistic data
Intentionally introduce the quality issues listed above
Document how data was generated and why quality issues exist
2. Bronze Layer — Ingestion
Read CSVs from S3/DBFS into Databricks
Create Bronze tables (raw, unchanged data)
Handle schema inference and data types
Log ingestion metadata (row counts, timestamp)
No transformations or cleaning — just raw ingest
3. Silver Layer — Data Quality & Validation
Implement below quality checks:
Completeness: No NULLs in critical fields (email, customer_id, product_id)
Uniqueness: No duplicate rows (order_id, customer_id)
Referential Integrity: Foreign keys exist (every customer_id, every product_id)
Flag bad rows (don't delete — add quality_check_result column)
Generate quality metrics report (% passed each check)
4. Gold Layer — Aggregations & Analytics
Build three aggregation tables:
A) Sales by Product:
product_id, product_name, category
total_orders, total_revenue, avg_order_value
B) Revenue by Customer:
customer_id, customer_name, customer_segment
total_orders, total_revenue, avg_order_value, lifetime_value_actual
C) Customer Segmentation:
segment_type (High-Value/Repeat/One-Time/Inactive)
customer_count, avg_revenue, total_revenue
5. BI Dashboard
Create Databricks SQL Dashboard with 3+ tiles
Visualizations: Top 10 products by revenue (bar), Customer revenue distribution (histogram), Customer segmentation (pie)
Write queries, configure visualizations, add filters
Core Acceptance Criteria:
[ ] Sample data generated (3 CSVs with intentional issues)
[ ] Bronze layer ingests all three sources successfully
[ ] Silver layer implements all four quality checks
[ ] Quality report shows % passed for each check
[ ] Gold layer produces all three aggregation tables
[ ] Aggregation calculations are correct (sum, count, avg, etc.)
[ ] Dashboard displays all 3+ visualizations
[ ] All code is readable, commented, documented
[ ] README setup instructions work end-to-end
[ ] Data quality tests pass (verify checks catch intentional issues)

10. Tool-Specific Expectations: Cursor
Expectations for Cursor Users
Submit tool-specific/cursor-workflow/ with:
project-context.md — How you set up project context for Cursor
spec.md — Your design/specification document
cursor-rules-or-instructions.md — Cursor rules, .cursorrules file, or instructions you used
task-breakdown.md — Tasks as you defined them to Cursor
Show Evidence Of:
 ✅ Persistent project context — How you provided context to Cursor repeatedly
 ✅ Iteration — Multiple refinement cycles; accepting some suggestions, rejecting others
 ✅ Validation — How you verified Cursor-generated code worked before accepting it
Strong Cursor Usage Shows:
You wrote a design spec, shared it with Cursor, and built against it
You used .cursorrules or similar to enforce project standards
Your commit history shows you iterating: accepting → testing → fixing → refining
Your prompts were specific ("Generate quality check for completeness on these 3 fields") not vague ("write data quality code")
You tested Cursor-generated SQL/Python/PySpark before deploying it
You rejected suggestions that didn't match your architecture
Weak Cursor Usage Shows:
One-line prompts only; no context provided upfront
Copying code directly without understanding it
No evidence of testing or validation
Prompts like "generate code" with no specification
Missing git history or shallow commits
No documented reasoning for accepting/rejecting suggestions

11. What Counts as Complete
For your feedback to be useful, your submission should include:
 ✅ A working end-to-end pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Dashboard)
 ✅ Sample data generator with realistic quality issues
 ✅ All four quality checks implemented and working
 ✅ All three Gold layer aggregations
 ✅ Dashboard with 3+ SQL queries and visualizations
 ✅ Database schema/setup script and seed data
 ✅ README with working setup instructions
 ✅ Basic test suite (data quality tests, pipeline integration tests)
 ✅ Full prompt history with all AI interactions documented
 ✅ Requirement analysis, design notes, test strategy
 ✅ Debugging notes and code review notes
 ✅ Reflection on what you learned
If pieces are missing you will still get feedback — it just won't reflect the full picture, and the growth pointers will focus on filling those gaps.
12. How to Take Part
Once your project is ready, you share it through a single online form. There is no review call to book and nothing to host or deploy.
What You Share 
A link to your Git repository using ttn email id. The same repo can be cloned to the databricks community edition (free) for development/testing/validations. 
Short written answers to questions in the form about your work
About the Questions
The questions ask you to explain your work in your own words:
Your understanding of the medallion architecture problem
How you used AI across data generation, ingestion, validation, aggregation
Key design and implementation decisions made through AI
Your testing and validation approach
How you validated AI output
What you'd improve next
Be specific and honest. This is for your own development, so there is no value in generic or inflated answers — they just produce less useful feedback. The clearer picture you give of how you actually worked, the more useful your growth pointers will be.
Follow-Up and Coaching
Your work is reviewed and a feedback report is shared with you. Sometimes a mentor or your competency owner may follow up to talk through your project and coach you on next steps — a short, supportive conversation, not a re-examination. This is part of how the competency helps you grow.
13. What Good Looks Like
The feedback weighs how you used AI across the lifecycle and how well you understand and own your solution — not just whether the pipeline runs.
Strong Work Usually Shows
 ✅ Clear requirement understanding — Good breakdown of Bronze/Silver/Gold layers, acceptance criteria
 ✅ Well-documented AI prompts — Context-setting, refinement, correction of wrong suggestions
 ✅ Working pipeline end-to-end — All layers function, data persists, dashboard displays correctly
 ✅ Data quality thinking — All checks work, quality report is clear, intentional issues caught
 ✅ Clean, maintainable code — Readable, documented, follows naming conventions
 ✅ Meaningful testing — Quality validation tests, integration tests, evidence of debugging
 ✅ Honest reflection — Can explain trade-offs, show what you learned, reusable patterns documented
Weaker Work Usually Shows
 ❌ Direct copy-paste from AI — Little understanding; missing requirement analysis
 ❌ Shallow prompt history — No clear design; prompts lack context
 ❌ Broken setup instructions — README doesn't work; no data persistence
 ❌ Superficial testing — No evidence quality checks catch their issues
 ❌ Generic documentation — Can't explain the code; no ownership
 ❌ Missing artifacts — Prompt history, reflection, testing, or debugging notes absent
In short: The journey and your understanding matter as much as the final code. Make your thinking visible.
14. Your Growth Path
Whatever your starting point, the feedback comes with a direction for what to develop next:
Building the basics:
Focus on requirement analysis and providing context to your AI tool
Get to a working, tested pipeline end-to-end
Next step: Move toward solid practice
Solid and growing:
You produce working AI-assisted pipelines
Quality checks and aggregations work reliably
Next step: Deepen testing, review quality, and debugging maturity
Strong across the lifecycle:
You use AI well end-to-end (design → implementation → testing)
Can explain your decisions and trade-offs
Next step: Advanced testing, performance optimization, reusable patterns/libraries
Ready to lead:
Mature workflow with reusable prompt templates, specs, or pipeline frameworks
Can mentor others on AI-assisted data engineering
Natural point to share practices and contribute to org standards
Your competency owner uses the report and this direction within your normal growth conversations — it informs where you are in the AI capability framework rather than stamping a grade on you.
